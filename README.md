# Unusual Volume Detector --- [New Website!  ](https://unusualvolume.info/):

This scans every ticker on the market, gets their last 5 months of volume history, and alerts you when a stock's volume exceeds 10 standard deviations from the mean within the last 3 days. (these numbers are all adjustable).  Helps find anomalies in the stock market

## Easiest way to see this:

Go to the [website](https://unusualvolume.info/)


### How to run the script:
- Download your favorite Python IDE. (I use VSCode)
- Get my script from GitHub
- Open the script in your IDE and install all required dependancies by typing pip install -r requirements.txt into the IDE's terminal. You can get to the the terminal on VSC by pressing CMD and ` at the same time.
- Run the market_scanner.py and it will print out results into the terminal
- You can also graph any ticker's volume in grapher.py

### Controlling the Script
- Line 17 controls the amount of months of historical volume the script gets
- Line 75 controls the amount of days before today that it will alert you
- Line 84 controls the number of standard deviations away from the mean volume
